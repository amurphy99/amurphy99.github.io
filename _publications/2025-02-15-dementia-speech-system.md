This paper describes an end-to-end conversational speech system designed for robotic interactions with people living with dementia. The system combines real-time ASR/TTS with a dementia-oriented LLM and a mobile PWA interface to display speech biomarker scores, and evaluates multiple biomarkers (and a composite score) across both clinician-led and robot-led conversation datasets.
