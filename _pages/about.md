I am a CS PhD student at DePaul University, advised by [Dr. Casey Bennett](https://www.caseybennett.com/). 
======
My research is centered around **Artificial Intelligence**, **Wearable Technology**, and **Clinical Health Monitoring**. My work focuses on building end-to-end systems that transform passive data, like speech and physiological signals, into actionable digital biomarkers.

Recently, I've been working on two primary domains:
1.  **Speech AI for Cognitive Health:** Developing agentic conversational systems and NLP pipelines to monitor neurodegenerative decline in dementia patients.
2.  **Wearable Sensing for Affective Computing:** Utilizing PPG-derived heart rate variability (HRV) and signal processing to track longitudinal anxiety symptoms.
